Robot code for 24-25 Lightning Blue Lizzards FRC competition.

The Code of Lightning Lizards-

In a cave where the skies hum electric and bright,
The lightning-blue lizards convene every night.
Their scales shimmer softly with a radiant glow,
A storm in their veins, and their minds all aglow.

Each lizard a coder, with claws deft and keen,
They craft vivid worlds on their glowing screens.
With sparks in their eyes and a rhythm to share,
They tackle great challenges with collaborative flair.

One writes the logic, a master of flow,
Another debugs where the errors might grow.
A third lizard weaves in the visuals and hues,
While the fourth tests the code, finding what to improve.

“Compile!” one declares, with a flick of their tail,
The code runs like lightning, it cannot fail.
Through teamwork and focus, their project takes flight,
Programs of brilliance, born in the night.

They teach us, these lizards, with sparks from above:
That coding’s an art, built on teamwork and love.
So here’s to the coders, electric and true,
May we learn from the lightning and glow just as blue.
